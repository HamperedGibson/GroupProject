# *Group Work Review*
## Interest of content [6/10] - Very Good

There's a good range of niche topics which are interesting to learn about. A little more detail would have been nice, but I think the choice of subject matter was sufficiently novel to be engaging on its own. 
    
##  Consistency and quality of visual presentation [5/10] - Good

The visual presentation is largely consistent, with a few minor deviations - colour of navbar, etc. - across pages by different authors. The quality is also slightly variable, but tailored well to quantity of subject matter present.
    
##  Quality of written presentation [7/10] - Excellent

Very few SPaG errors, and well-written sentences in general. Only one typo was found across the three pages.
    
## Validity of HTML [6/10] - Very Good

No console errors, and the source code generally looks sound and well-formed. Indentation and formatting are all correct, and comments are used correctly to identify the various sections of the documents. There are a small number of features which do not seem to work as intended - a search bar and one page's navigation system - but the website is functional overall.
    
##  Evidence of collaboration [7/10] - Excellent

###   Author info not written by author
The author information was written by the other members of the group, as evidenced by the git repo history.

###   Balanced contributions from members
All contributors created similar quantities of text, with each managing a single specific page. Similar numbers of lines were contributed by all three members of the group.

###   Not completed at the last minute
It was largely completed over the course of the week, with heavier work done closer to the deadline. No work was left obviously unfinished.
